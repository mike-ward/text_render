# Requirements: VGlyph v1.7 Stabilization

**Defined:** 2026-02-05
**Core Value:** Reliable text rendering without crashes or undefined
behavior

## v1.7 Requirements

### Diagnosis

- [x] **DIAG-01**: Root cause identified for stress_demo scroll
  flickering
- [x] **DIAG-02**: Root cause identified for visible rendering delays
- [x] **DIAG-03**: Root cause identified for blank scroll regions

### Fix

- [x] **FIX-01**: Scroll flickering resolved in stress_demo
- [x] **FIX-02**: Rendering delays resolved in stress_demo
- [x] **FIX-03**: Blank scroll regions resolved in stress_demo
- [x] **FIX-04**: If root cause unfixable, specific v1.6 change
  rolled back with rationale — N/A (fix succeeded)

### Verification

- [x] **VRFY-01**: stress_demo scrolls without flickering or blanks
- [x] **VRFY-02**: editor_demo renders and edits without regression
- [x] **VRFY-03**: atlas_debug renders without regression
- [x] **VRFY-04**: All tests pass (`v test`)
